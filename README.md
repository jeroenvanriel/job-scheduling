# Job Scheduling
This repository contains some implementation of algorithms for solving makespan scheduling problem. This project was done as part of the course Mathematical Modelling (2WH30) at TUe.

## LPT rule
The simple longest processing time first rule is implemented in `LPT_rule.py`.

## Simulated annealing

[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing)

The simulated annealing is implemented in `simann/simann.py`. The script `simann/example.py` contains an example on how to perform a simulated annealing experiment and how to store the results to a file. Note that the file `simann/p_functions.py` is used to define different acceptance probability functions to experiment with.
